# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately and do not open a public issue.

- Subject: `with.md security report`
- Include:
  - Affected component/path
  - Reproduction steps or proof of concept
  - Expected impact/severity
  - Any suggested fix (optional)

We will acknowledge receipt as quickly as possible and coordinate remediation
and disclosure with you.

## Scope

This policy applies to this repository and the services/components documented
in `README.md`:

- `web/` (Next.js app + API routes)
- `convex/` (backend functions/schema)
- `hocuspocus-server/` (realtime websocket bridge)

## Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research. Please:
